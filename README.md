Hi, I'm Senior Ruby on Rails engineer (Rails 4–7) focused on performance, caching, and reliability. Led edge + application caching strategy that reduced p95 from 1.7s (30s under crawler load) to <100ms and stabilized delivery during origin incidents. I build APIs, data pipelines/imports, integrations, and internal tooling; ship with tests, CI, and observability
